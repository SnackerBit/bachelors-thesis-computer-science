abstract = {We present the non-Markovian generalisation of the widely used stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our result allows one to describe open quantum systems in terms of stochastic state vectors rather than density operators, without Markov approximation. Moreover, it unifies two recent independent attempts towards a stochastic description of non-Markovian open systems, based on path integrals on the one hand and coherent states on the other. The latter approach utilises the analytical properties of coherent states and enables a microscopic interpretation of the stochastic states. The alternative first approach is based on the general description of open systems using path integrals as originated by Feynman and Vernon.}

    abstract = "{The Zusman equation has been widely used to study the effect of solvent dynamics on electron transfer reactions. However, application of this equation is limited by the classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom. In this paper, we revisit the Zusman equation in the framework of the exact hierarchical equations of motion formalism, and show that a high temperature approximation of the hierarchical theory is equivalent to the Zusman equation in describing electron transfer dynamics. Thus the exact hierarchical formalism naturally extends the Zusman equation to include quantum nuclear dynamics at low temperatures. This new finding has also inspired us to rescale the original hierarchical equations and incorporate a filtering algorithm to efficiently propagate the hierarchical equations. Numerical exact results are also presented for the electron transfer reaction dynamics and rate constant calculations.}",
