abstract = {We present the non-Markovian generalisation of the widely used stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our result allows one to describe open quantum systems in terms of stochastic state vectors rather than density operators, without Markov approximation. Moreover, it unifies two recent independent attempts towards a stochastic description of non-Markovian open systems, based on path integrals on the one hand and coherent states on the other. The latter approach utilises the analytical properties of coherent states and enables a microscopic interpretation of the stochastic states. The alternative first approach is based on the general description of open systems using path integrals as originated by Feynman and Vernon.}

However, application of this equation is limited by the classical treatment of the nuclear degrees of freedom. In this paper, we revisit the Zusman equation in the framework of the exact hierarchical equations of motion formalism, and show that a high temperature approximation of the hierarchical theory is equivalent to the Zusman equation in describing electron transfer dynamics. Thus the exact hierarchical formalism naturally extends the Zusman equation to include quantum nuclear dynamics at low temperatures. This new finding has also inspired us to rescale the original hierarchical equations and incorporate a filtering algorithm to efficiently propagate the hierarchical equations. Numerical exact results are also presented for the electron transfer reaction dynamics and rate constant calculations.}",

The main difference from the previous non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) method is that the complex Gaussian stochastic process used for the forward propagation of the wave function is correlated, which may be used to reduce the amplitude of the non-Markovian memory term at high temperatures. The new SSE is then written into the recently developed hierarchy of pure states scheme, in a form that is more closely related to the hierarchical equation of motion approach. Numerical simulations are then performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the new method. }",

We show that TDVP-MU and TDVP-PS yield the same result when the time step size is converged and they are more accurate than P\\&amp;C-RK4, while TDVP-PS tolerates a larger time step size than TDVP-MU. We further adopt the graphical processing units to accelerate the heavy tensor contractions in the TD-DMRG, and it is able to speed up the TDVP-MU and TDVP-PS schemes by up to 73 times.}",

For the DMRG to be conveniently used in different problems described by different Hamiltonians, in this work, we propose a new generic algorithm to construct the MPO of an arbitrary operator with a sum-of-products form based on the bipartite graph theory. We show that the method has the following advantages: (i) it is automatic in that only the definition of the operator is required; (ii) it is symbolic thus free of any numerical error; (iii) the complementary operator technique can be fully employed so that the resulting MPO is globally optimal for any given order of degrees of freedom; and (iv) the symmetry of the system could be fully employed to reduce the dimension of MPO. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm, the MPOs of Hamiltonians ranging from the prototypical spin–boson model and the Holstein model to the more complicated ab initio electronic Hamiltonian and the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian with the sextic force field are constructed. It is found that for the former three cases, our automatic algorithm can reproduce exactly the same MPOs as the optimally hand-crafted ones already known in the literature.}",
