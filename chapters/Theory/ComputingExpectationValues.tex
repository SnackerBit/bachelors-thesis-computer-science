Both in linear and non-linear HOPS the density matrix of the system is computed by
averaging over multiple realizations of pure states, see equations 
(\ref{eq:averaging_states_linear}) and (\ref{eq:averaging_states_nonlinear}).
However, mostly one is not interested in the density matrix directly, but in 
the expectation value of a given operator $\hat{A}$. In linear HOPS, the average
is taken over unnormalized states, and thus the expectation value can be computed as
\begin{equation}
    \left\langle\hat{A}\right\rangle_t 
    = \frac{\trace\left\{\rho(t)\hat{A}\right\}}{\trace\left\{\rho(t)\right\}}
    \approx \frac{\trace\left\{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ket*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\bra*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\hat{A}\right\}}
    {\trace\left\{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ket*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\bra*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\right\}}
    = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bra*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\hat{A}\ket*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}}
    {\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bra*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}\ket*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}},
\end{equation}
where we denote different realizations $i$ of the stochastic process with $z^*_i, i=0,\dots,N$ and we used the
cyclic property of the trace.
\\
In non-linear HOPS the average is taken over normalized states $\ket*{\widetilde{\Psi}_t\left(z^*\right)}$ instead,
and thus it holds $\text{tr}\left\{\rho\right\} = 1$. The expectation value can then be
computed as
\begin{equation}
    \left\langle\hat{A}\right\rangle_t 
    = \frac{\trace{\rho(t)\hat{A}}}{\trace{\rho(t)}}
    \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \bra*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)} \hat{A} \ket*{\Psi_t(z^*_i)}
\end{equation}
