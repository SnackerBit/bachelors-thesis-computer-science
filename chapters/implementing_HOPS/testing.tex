To test my implementation of the HOPS, I use the spin boson model (\ref{eq:system_hamiltonian_SBM}) with $\Delta = 1$ and $\epsilon = 0$. 
For the bath correlation function I use the simple expansion
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha(\tau) = ge^{-\omega\tau}
\end{equation*}
with only a single bath mode and constants $g = 2$ and $\omega = 0.5 + 2i$. The constants for the spin-boson model
and the bath correlation function are taken from \cite{Suess:2014}. In figure \ref{fig:full_runs_HOPS}, the dynamics
of the model is shown, computed using 100, 1000, and 10000 realizations of the stochastic process. Both linear and non-linear 
HOPS are shown. One can directly see that the linear HOPS converges much slower. The reason for this is that the difference in 
magnitudes of the states from different realizations of the stochastic process can be really large (see figure \ref{fig:HOPS_linear_magnitudes}).
Because of this, most realizations do not contribute much to the stochastic expectation value, which is therefore dominated
by only a few realizations with large magnitudes. In the non-linear HOPS, states are normalized, and thus each realization
is weighted equally in the stochastic expectation value, leading to faster convergence.\\
