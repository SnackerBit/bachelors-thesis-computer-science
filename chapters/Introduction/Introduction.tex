Open quantum systems, ie. quantum systems that are interacting with an environment, are important for modelling many complex
processes, like the decoherence of quantum computers and processes in the field of chemical physics.
Most of the time, these systems cannot be described analytically, but only numerically. Thus, the field of open quantum system
simulation is very important.\\
A popular approach for the simulation of open quantum systems is the Hierarchy Of Pure States (HOPS) \cite{Suess:2014}.
With HOPS, one can integrate the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equation and simulate non-markovian open quantum systems.
Recently, it was shown that the popular Matrix Product State formalism can be used to derive a Hierarchy Of Matrix Pure States (HOMPS),
which can drastically improve the memory requirements for HOPS. \\
The goal of this thesis is to implement and benchmark both HOPS and HOMPS in detail. I start by giving a derivation of HOPS
from the non-markovian quantum state diffusion equation in section \ref{chap:HOPS}. Next, I explain in detail how HOPS can be implemented and
test the method on the spin boson model in section \ref{chap:Implementing_HOMPS}. In section \ref{chap:Implementing_HOMPS}, i derive and implement
HOMPS, and test it on the spin boson model as well. Finally, I give a conclusion and some references on how to further improve the methods in
section \ref{chap:Conclusion}.
\\
My implementation of both HOPS and HOMPS, including the code that was used to generate all plots in this thesis, is openly available
under \cite{Sappler:2023}.
