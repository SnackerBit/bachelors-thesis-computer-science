As a second test, I use a low temperature and high damping case of the spin-boson model (\ref{eq:system_hamiltonian_SBM}). I again use the Debye spectral
density and set the parameters to $T = 0.02$, $\gamma = 5$, $\eta = 0.5$, $\epsilon = 2$, $\Delta = -2$, which are also used in \cite{Suess:2014,Song:2016}.
The approximations of the bath correlation function using the Matsubara summation and Padé approximation methods are shown in Figures \ref{fig:low_T_BCF_convergence_matsubara} and \ref{fig:low_T_BCF_convergence_pade} respectively.
At low temperatures the Padé approximation converges a lot faster than the Matsubara summation. The following computations are done with $K=13$ terms of the
Padé approximation, which yields a sufficiently converged BCF.

\noindent Because now multiple bath nodes are used, the MPS needs to be truncated in order to keep computation times managable. In Figure \ref{fig:homps_low_T_eps_convergence_sigma_z_and_max_bond_dim}, 
the HOMPS equations are integrated using different values for the truncation threshhold $\epsilon_\text{SVD}$. After each Singular Value Decomposition,
singular values smaller than the truncation threshhold are omitted. Lower threshhold values lead to larger bond dimensions, which drastically increases computation times.
For the spin-boson model, a truncation threshhold of $\epsilon_\text{SVD} = 1.e-3$ yields good results and leads to a maximal bond dimension
of $\chi_{\text{max}} \approx 2$.
Finally, I integrate the HOMPS equations using 100, 1000, and 10000 realizations of the stochastic process in Figure \ref{fig:HOMPS_low_T_multiple_realizations}.
The parameters used are $K = 13$, $N_\text{trunc} = 9$, and $\epsilon_\text{SVD} = 10^{-3}$; The integration method is RK4. The results match well the ones obtained in \cite{Suess:2014,Song:2016}.
Note that the effect of the noise is low compared to the high temperature case (compare figure \ref{fig:homps_high_T_full_runs} and \ref{fig:HOMPS_low_T_multiple_realizations}).
